# Space Travel :rocket:

> Responsive web application

The app allows users to buy a one-way ticket to a Planet in the Solar System in a situation when the environment on Earth is not livable anymore (the tickets canâ€™t be used, yet). Customers can check the air quality in their location to make an informed decision about this important matter.

## Prerequisites

Docker, docker-compose, node, yarn.

Install client dependencies in the root directory:

```bash
yarn install
```

Install server dependencies in the `server` directory:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Auth secrets

In `server` directory create a `.env` file:

```bash
NODE_PATH=src
PRISMA_SECRET=your-prisma-secret
APP_SECRET=your-app-secret
```

> Find more about the secrets in [Prisma docs.](<https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/service-configuration/prisma.yml/yaml-structure-ufeshusai8/#secret-(optional)>)

## API keys

In project root create a `.env` file:

```bash
NODE_PATH=src
REACT_APP_PRISMA_SECRET=your-prisma-secret
REACT_APP_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-secret
REACT_APP_AQICN_API_KEY=your-aqicn-api-key
REACT_APP_MAPBOX_API_KEY=your-mapbox-api-key
```

Get your AQICN API key [here.](https://aqicn.org/data-platform/token/)

Get your Mapbox API token following [this guide.](https://www.mapbox.com/help/how-access-tokens-work/#creating-and-managing-access-tokens)

## Server

### Setup

In `server` directory, run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Then deploy the Prisma service:

```bash
yarn prisma deploy
```

#### Development

To start development server, run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

#### Production

To start production server, run:

```bash
yarn start
```

## Client

#### Development

In the project root directory, run:

```sh
yarn start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### Production

```sh
yarn build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
